# OS_SimulationProj

This was a project for my Operating Systems class. 
The purpose of this project was to gain understanding of the different process scheduling algorithms used
from object oriented implementations.

The project includes:
    Implementations of First-Come-First-Served, Shortest Process Next, and Round Robin scheduling.
    A generic process block class (PCB).
    A text file full of randomly generated parameters that are used for generating the PCB objects.
